## Description
This repository that contains all of the scripts that I'm constantly doing for the extension of WFx for Workflowy.

## Instructions
To setup one of this scripts you should have WFx for Workflowy.
- My shared link is this one: [Wfx +](https://workflowy.com/s/wfx/00IhBAq7YIIJCJh4)
IMPORTANT! You must add the WFx+ share to your outline for scripts to work properly.
- To create a shortcut, zoom on the bullet with JavaScript in the note.
- Scripts will have one of these tags in the name: #rfw, #setup, or #js.
- Activate Shortcut Maker wfs and follow the prompts.
- #rfw (Run From WorkFlowy) These scripts will only prompt you for a shortcut.
- #setup These will have additional setup prompts for custom settings.
- #js These scripts are designed to run in all tabs, not just WorkFlowy.


## Scripts
### Multi Noter

**Note**: If in multi noter you put a link to another Workflowy node, it will paste the link formatted!

Will display a list of tags, where you can select one. Also you can type whatever you want and it provides you with three options.
- Append which will put the tag at the end of your first line in the note
- Prepend which will put the tag at the beginning of your note
- New line which will create a new first line in the note and put the tags in there. This is useful if you have a really long note and you want to begin your node with the tags.

### Sort by descendants
One image speaks more that a thousand words (In this case, 3 images)

### Move to Grandchild 
If you know _moveToChild_ from the WFx extension, probably you guess what this does. It moves the node that you are, to a grand children location.
#### Use case

Let's say you are a calendar driven task person. So probably in Workflowy you have a stucture like this for each day:
- Calendar
  * January
    * 2021.01.06
    * 2021.01.07
    * 2021.01.08
  * February
    * 2021.02.06
    * 2021.02.07
    * 2021.02.08
  * March
    * 2021.03.06
    * 2021.03.07
    * 2021.03.08

So, now, you are in your inbox dealing with tasks from that day and you come across a task that you would like to do on 2021.01.06, no problem! You activate WFx, type your shortcut for _moveToGrandchild_ and something like this will come up:

Once you select your month, this other dialog will come up:

...and that's all. Use your imagination, this was only for dates, but it could be widely used in another ways.
